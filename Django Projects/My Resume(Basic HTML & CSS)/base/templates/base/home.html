            <h4>My Education Journey</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I embarked on my educational journey after high school, pursuing a
              Bachelor's degree in Computer Science to build a strong foundation
              in the field. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I gained
              knowledge in programming, algorithms, software development, and
              databases. Eager to expand my knowledge, I pursued a Master's
              degree in Information Management Systems, where I delved into
              advanced topics like data analytics, information security, and
              project management. Engaging in research and practical projects
              during my Master's program, I am equipped with a comprehensive
              understanding of information management systems and computer
              science, ready to make a positive impact in this dynamic field.

              Reverse Engineer, attend online courses & Build Ugly Prototypes

            <p>
              I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear
              apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out
              why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a
              reference.

            <h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              After almost several years of learning and not working as a
              developer Iâ€™m ready to work on real projects and learn something
              new. I'll be collaborating and sharing my thoughts with any team I
              work with and I'll try to be passionate about delivering projects
              on time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a
              position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others
              with more experience than myself.
